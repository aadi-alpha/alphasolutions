          <h3>Waterproofing</h3>
          <p>Maccem Solutions offers reliable waterproofing services to protect buildings from water seepage and
            dampness. We apply advanced materials like liquid membranes and coatings to areas such as terraces,
            basements, and bathrooms. Our team ensures proper surface preparation and precise application to prevent
            leakage and long-term structural damage.</p>

          <h3>Tile Leakage Repair</h3>
          <p>Leaking tiles often go unnoticed until they cause major problems. At Maccem Solutions, we use modern,
            non-invasive techniques like grouting and sealant injections to repair tile leakage without breaking the
            surface. Ideal for bathrooms, kitchens, and terraces, our solutions restore waterproofing and extend the
            life of your tiled spaces.
